# ZKOSIS: Verifiable AI Inference on Ethereum

ZKOSIS is a next-generation compute protocol that brings cryptographically verifiable AI inference to the Ethereum blockchain. By seamlessly integrating zero-knowledge proofs, smart contract attestations, and AI model execution, ZKOSIS offers a modular and trustless architecture. This innovative system transforms machine learning predictions into on-chain, integrity-proven outcomes, leveraging zk-SNARKs and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible infrastructure for a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving solution.

## What ZKOSIS Delivers

ZKOSIS provides a robust set of features designed to ensure security, verifiability, and immutability for AI computations:

- **Secure Inference Execution**: Full input/output sealing safeguards privacy and security throughout the process.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: Every AI computation is backed by a zk-SNARK proof, ensuring cryptographic integrity.
- **On-Chain Validation**: Model execution is validated on Ethereum using `Verifier.sol`, guaranteeing trustless verification.
- **Integrity Attestation**: `AttestManager.sol` delivers reliable integrity assurances for all outputs.
- **Immutable Publication**: Results are permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and accessibility.

## How ZKOSIS Works

The ZKOSIS protocol operates through an efficient and well-defined pipeline, making AI inference both verifiable and blockchain-integrated:

1. **User Input**: Users submit prompts or data samples to initiate the process.
2. **MCP Server**: A secure Model Control Plane (MCP) server processes the inference request.
3. **ezkl Inference**: The AI model executes within a zero-knowledge-compatible framework powered by ezkl.
4. **Proof Generation**: zk-SNARKs, using either Groth16 or PLONK, are generated to cryptographically validate the computation.
5. **Verifier.sol**: A Solidity smart contract verifies the proof on-chain, ensuring correctness.
6. **AttestManager.sol**: The verified output is attested and logged for integrity assurance.
7. **On-Chain Log**: Results are published immutably on the Ethereum blockchain, available for permanent access.
